# LocAds

<h1>Location Based Advertisements App</h1>
    
    Created in Android Studio
    With the help of Java 

<p>
    Idea is 
    when a person visits a new place he doesn't know what is best place to visit in that new place he may ask some other person about that.
    So when a person installed our app and went to a new place 
        He will get notification on their mobile when he is nearer to that store which is registered on our admin app
        when we click on that notification it will displays the offers and details of that store
        So that he can visit that store with attractive offers on that store
